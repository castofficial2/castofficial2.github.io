Gravy
Mr. Sandman bring me a dream 
Make him the cutest that I’ve ever seen 
Give him two lips like roses and clover 
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Gravy make it splash like Pippen
Shit that’s nothin’ (splash)
Errbody call me Big Pimpin’
No, I ain’t bluffin'
I'm with your mom in the kitchen
Makin’ blueberry muffins
Must be Thanksgiving
'Cause your bitch want the stuffing

And yo bitch look like a pinhead
All my haters, they be skinheads
Pissed off 'cause they wife is they sister
And Yung Gravy just kissed her (hot damn)
Pull up on the scene
'Cause a wet dream I might need a submarine
If you got the beef I turn yo ass to smitherines (uh)
Yo bitch looking scary I thought it was Halloween
Gravy, he be clean like some fucking Listerine (uh)
But I smooth it out like a jar of Vaseline

Turn these bitches on 'cause I’m really good at Bop-It
Clean in, clean out
Pullin' up drop top Viper

Finessed it like I’m Swiper
So much bread gotta get my fiber
Gravy, he be cleaner than your windshield wipers (uh)
Your step-mom made me a pie
You can call me the Pied-Piper (sheesh)

But I'll eat my girls ass if she had a bad day (aye)

Stay with three hoes like it’s the holidays
Stuck to the bread, you would think I’m mayonnaise
