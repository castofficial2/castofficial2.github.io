You're too blind to see
This planet is a prison for the damned, eugh
Go 'head and break your bread
With all your so called friends
Like they won't they take your head, ah
Go 'head and break your bread
With all your so called friends
Like they don't want you dead
D-D-Doing anything to really get up how you want
Niggas always sprinting, leaving niggas in the dust
Watching how I do it, they can never get enough
Still stuck in my ways and I don't think I'll ever budge
I just got my advance, I'm about to run it up
Married to the game so I won't ever fall in love
I see all your desperate texts
I leave them on read 'cause I don't give a fuck
Guilty
Who gives a fuck anyway?
We all die anyway
So go kill him
Who gives a fuck anyway?
What's one less on this God-forsaken planet?
I'm in my zone right now, oh yah
I'm in my zone right now, oh yah
I'm in my zone, oh yah, oh yah
I'm in my zone right now, oh yah
I'm in my zone right now, oh yah
I'm in my zone right now, oh yah
I'm in my zone
Peace will exist in the mind, sever my patience
T-T-These thoughts are basic, these conversations
Can't take them nowhere, I give no fucks now
Don't act sublime, leave m--
D-D-Doing anything to really get up how you want (Weh)
Niggas always sprinting, leaving niggas in the dust
Watching how I do it, they can never get enough
Still stuck in my ways and I don't think I'll ever budge
I just got my advance, I'm about to run it up
Married to the game so I won't ever fall in love
I see all your desperate texts
I leave them on read 'cause I don't give a fuck
Aye, yah
Feelings that I'm feeling don't affect my state of being
I got rackies coming in, 'bout to pay off all my demons
I've been keeping my plate empty, it's the hatred they be feeling
I'm so sick of all the violence, inside all you human beings
Let them talk their shit, we weren't listening anyway
Let them say their piece, we don't listen to their fucking mouths
Reason I don't trust; where were you when we were starving?
Had to leave that bitch, the only thing she loved was my wallet
