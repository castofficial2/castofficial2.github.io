Six bands, make it double
Hit 'em on the head, red dot in the jungle
Catch me walkin' slow, pockets racked, it make me stumble
I'm gon' get the guap and I'll do it with no struggle
Flexin' big racks, I will never be the same
Yes, I pop another xan, drop a band all on my chain, yeah
She stay textin' me, she don't text you, you a lame
She just hopped inside the 'Rari, shawty countin' up my cake
I ain't even on yet but these checks comin'
All these lames on my line, stop pretendin', you not kin, yeah
When I was down, where were you, come again?
If I catch another opp, he get blasted in the shin
I just spent a check and I made it right back
Hundred racks on my neck with the Glock on my lap
I'm runnin' from the pole, man, I'mma do the dash
Catch me speedin' in designer, all black gucci on the hat
Six bands, make it double
Hit 'em on the head, red dot in the jungle
Catch me walkin' slow, pockets racked, it make me stumble
I'm gon' get the guap and I'll do it with no struggle
Flexin' big racks, I will never be the same
Yes, I pop another xan, drop a band all on my chain, yeah
She stay textin' me, she don't text you, you a lame
She just hopped inside the 'Rari, shawty countin' up my cake
CDG my Converse, Cuban links around my neck
Got me workin' all these hours, I been cashin' all these checks
And this bitches hit me up but I don't mean no disrespect
I'm just too busy countin' money, I don't need you in my head
All these shawties hit my phone, I'm poppin' xannies like a Tec
Hella Sketchy rollin' dope, we smokin' till there's nothing left
And don't you ask about a song unless you plan to spend a check
Spent some money, stole some [?] and then I jugg it right back
Fuck a handout, fuck some friends, bitch I did this by myself
All you people looked me down when you saw I needed help
Now I'm poppin' but you never even cared how I felt
Catch me cruisin' in some vintage with the full black Gucci belt
Six bands, make it double
Hit 'em on the head, red dot in the jungle
Catch me walkin' slow, pockets racked, it make me stumble
I'm gon' get that guap and I'll do it with no struggle
Flexin' big racks, I will never be the same
Yes, I pop another xan, drop a band all on my chain, yeah
She stay textin' me, she don't text you, you a lame
She just hopped inside the 'Rari, shawty countin' up my cake
