Yeah just vibe, vibe, vibe with me
Yeah just vibe, vibe, ride with me
Last night lost some money in a beachtown
Bad bitch, yeah, I should see if she was down
'Cause we were fresh outta high school baby
We weren't scared of the life we're living
Last night lost some money in a beachtown
Bad beach girl so unreal to be around
'Cause we were fresh outta high school baby
We weren't scared of the life we're living
Last night fell in love in a beach house
Shawty telling me she love me 'cause it's nice out
Shawty told me that she coming back to my house
And that's when I told shawty I had to dip out
'Cause we were fresh outta high school baby
'Cause we were fresh outta high school
'Cause we were fresh outta high school baby
We weren't scared of the life we're living
Last night fell in love in a beach town
Bad bitch, yeah, I should see if she was down
