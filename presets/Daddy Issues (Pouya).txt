MTM, hit 'em with the heat
Sometimes I can't fuck with your bitching
Wanna buy you a flight
Send yo ass back to yo daddy house
So you can think twice
But then I switch up my emotions
Rather be with you than forgotten
I can't have this crib to myself
Without you, I get too cautious
Now I'm back to being alone
Thinking about who you fucking with
Never wanted to catch no feelings
Not too good with apologies
I was used to being a lone wolf
Rolling with a few homies
Who had my back and wanted the best for me
Now I see clearly it ain't enough for me
She a nympho, I wanna fuck
Baby, let me get your info
Let me know what you wanna get yourself into
Yeah I know that you got some daddy issues
She a nympho, I wanna fuck
Baby, let me get your info
Let me know what you wanna get yourself into
Yeah I know that you got some daddy issues
Pull up in a Chevy
Now I'm ready to go
I got my nina by my side
You know she ready to blow
From side to side we got it jumping
Every function we go
I can't pay no mind to no hoe
That put a lump in my throat
5'5" take a lot to get a rise from me
Bending corners in my coupe
I know they eyeing me
Baby girl you know I love it
When you lie to me
Dead inside, feel alive
When you lie with me
She a nympho, I wanna fuck
Baby, let me get your info
Let me know what you wanna get yourself into
Yeah I know that you got some daddy issues
She a nympho, I wanna fuck
Baby, let me get your info
Let me know what you wanna get yourself into
Yeah I know that you got some daddy issues
